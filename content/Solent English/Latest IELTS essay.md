Dear Principal,

I am writing to bring your attention to a potentially life-threatening situation that I witnessed yesterday. As you are aware, it has been snowing heavily recently, and much of the area outside the college is iced over. At around 4 pm yesterday afternoon, I saw a group of students using the ramp leading to the main entrance as an improvised slide.

This is dangerous not only because students could fall and break a limb but also because of the proximity of the main road. On a number of occasions, I saw students skidding out of control and almost careering into the road and oncoming traffic.

I would strongly recommend that someone from the school's maintenance team apply some salt to the ramp so that it can no longer be used in this way. If this is not done, it is only a matter of time before someone has a serious accident.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.
